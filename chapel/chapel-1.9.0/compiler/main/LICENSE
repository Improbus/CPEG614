"The Chapel implementation is composed of two categories of code:\n"
"\n"
"1) code that was specifically developed for, or contributed to, the\n"
"   Chapel project.  This code comprises the core of the Chapel\n"
"   implementation: the compiler, runtime, and standard/internal\n"
"   modules.  Code in this category is made available under the\n"
"   3-clause BSD license, which can be found in 'LICENSE.chapel' in\n"
"   this directory.\n"
"\n"
"2) code from other open-source projects that we package and\n"
"   redistribute for the convenience of end-users.  Packages in this\n"
"   category are made available under the terms of their original\n"
"   licenses, respectively.\n"
"\n"
"   Packages in this second category are redistributed in the etc/ and\n"
"   third-party/ directories.  The following table provides a summary\n"
"   of the packages, their uses, and their licenses.\n"
